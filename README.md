# :milky_way: OpenGL renderer in Java
A scene renderer (rasterizer) written from scratch in Java using the [Light-Weight Java Games Library (LWJGL)](https://www.lwjgl.org/) to access the [OpenGL graphics API](https://www.opengl.org/). I decided to start this personal project to better understand how an OpenGL application works and to expand my graphics programming knowledge through hands-on experience. 

It started by creating a simple OpenGL application to draw a triangle on the screen (trust me- I was very excited to see it render!!), and has evolved to a more powerful renderer capable of drawing a scene with different meshes, applying lighting models and post-processing effects amongst others!
