# :milky_way: OpenGL renderer in Java
A scene renderer (rasterizer) written from scratch in Java using the [Light-Weight Java Games Library (LWJGL)](https://www.lwjgl.org/) to access the [OpenGL graphics API](https://www.opengl.org/). I decided to start this personal project to better understand how an OpenGL application works and to expand my graphics programming knowledge through hands-on experience. 

It started by creating a simple OpenGL application to draw a triangle on the screen (trust me- I was very excited to see it render!!), and has evolved to a more powerful renderer capable of drawing a scene with different meshes, applying lighting models and post-processing effects amongst others!

## :clipboard: Project Description

### :beginner: Some details and context:

#### Motivation:
After being introduced to OpenGL and it's rendering pipeline during an university course last year (Oct. 2019), during the summer (Aug. 2020) I decided to delve further into the details of how an OpenGL application works by building one from scratch! This way I aimed to explore in more detail the concepts that were mentioned during the lectures. To do this, I used a combination of on-line resources, including the great explanations from [https://learnopengl.com/](https://learnopengl.com/) (OpenGL & C++) and [ThinMatrix's playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS8wlS9hF8E&list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP) (Java LWJGL & OpenGL).

#### Project structure:
<img src="screenshot_samples/packages.png" alt="Project Structure" width="15%" align="right">

- The application uses 2 libraries: Light-Weight Java Games Library (LWJGL) and Java OpenGL Math Library (JOML). Their files are in the `lib` folder.
- The main application is included in the `main` package, with `Main`being the program that runs the application defined in `OpenGLApp`.
- The graphics framework is inside the `graphics` package, which has subpackages for each of the different parts of the framework.
- Any resources such as textures, models and shaders are in the appropriate folders in the `resources` folder.

#### Running the application:
When running the main program, a window where the rendering will take place appears. I have implemented the following controls:
- `Move your mouse` to look around the scene, and `scroll` to zoom.
- Use the `AWSD` keys to move left, forwards, backwards and right respectively. 
- Use the `left shift` and `left ctrl` keys to move up or down respectively.
- Press `F` to toggle (turn ON/OFF) the flashlight.
- Press `E` tp view the scene in wireframe mode.
- Press the numbers `0-5` to select the corresponding post-processing effect.

### :checkered_flag: Features already implemented:
Here is a list + short explanation of the features I have already implemented (not in the same order as they weere implemented):
- **Scene Graph** -- a scene to render is organised/stored in a graph. Each node can be either a drawable or abstract entity, which has a shape (with a mesh and material) or not respectively. This graph is traversed to render the entities in the scene.
- **Render Engine** -- allows to create the appropriate renderers (Renderer objects) for rendering different parts of the scene (either to the screen or to e.g. a custom FBO). A renderer uses the given ShaderProgram shader to render the scene.
- **Camera** -- the scene is rendered and can be seen as if from a 1st person view. You can move through the scene, look around and zoom in/out by using certain keyboard keys and a mouse (see 'how to use' section :wink:).
- **Shaders** -- loads and links together .glsl files for vertex, fragment and geometry shaders, creating a shader program OpenGL object that will be used for rendering.
- **Rendering Meshes** -- render meshes whose vertex, normals and texture coordinates are specified explicitly in their class.
- **Loading Models** -- parse an .OBJ file to extract the mesh data of a model, to use it in the application. Done using `assimp` (note: models made up of a single mesh).
- **Loading Images** -- parse image files in RGB or RGBA (e.g. jpg, png). Used for creating OpenGL textures to use when rendering.
- Objects have **materials** (to use with the **Phong or Blinn-Phong illumination models**):
  - Material -- allows you to use plain colours or **textures** for the diffuse & specular components.
  - **Reflective Material** -- a material that has full or partial reflection of the scene's skybox.
  - **Refractive Material** -- a material that has full or partial refraction of the scene's skybox.
- **Skybox** -- load the skybox's faces from 6 images and create an OpenGL cubemap object. Also render it using the appropriate renderer.
- **Lights** -- a scene can have a **directional light**, several **point lights** and a **flashlight** coming from the camera.
- **Shadows** -- uses **shadow mapping** to get the shadows for a scene's directional light and for a point light (later one is still in progress).
- **Post-processing Effects** -- can apply different post-processing effects to the rendered image. Done by rendering scene to a texture, then rendering a quad whose size is that of the screen and which uses the texture created; post-processing effects applied to this texture (may or may not use kernels to manipulate/process the image). e.g. inverting colours, greyscale, blur, sharpenning, edge detection...


### :construction: Currently working on:
- Correctly implementing omnidirectional shadow mapping for 1 point light. ðŸ ª  :warning: **issue:** latest attempt (which generates and renders the shadows- yay!- makes reflection and refraction of the skybox not work.)
- Next: omnidirectional shadow mapping for several point lights.

### :triangular_flag_on_post: (Ideas) New features to implement:
- Normal mapping
- Parallax mapping
- Bloom
- Ambient Occlusion
- Physically Based Rendering (PBR)
